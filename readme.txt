Allows administrators to globally hide Woocommerce coupon field from the cart page for each role and show optional message instead.

== Description ==

Coupons by Role plugin allows administrators to hide coupon field and button from the Woocommerce cart page for each group/role and optionally show text instead. This plugin is useful when you use role based pricing plugins since they do not discount prices with woocommerce functions and in those cases Woocommerce allows double discount where role based price and coupon can be stacked.
